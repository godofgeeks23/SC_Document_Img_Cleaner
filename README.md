# Screenshots + Document Images Cleaner
## A tool to clean the clutter of screenshots and images of documents.


In the times of online classes and exams, we all face a common big problem - the clutter of photos of pages and screenshots.

This media eats up the major disk space and looses its importance after the exam gets over.
So lets save our disk space by removing them...
But wait! why do this tedious task manually when the machine can do this

Use the python script that I wrote to achieve this!

##  Installation

Recommended Python version - 3.9

Clone the repo or download the code zip file.

Install the Python dependencies using - 

    pip install Pillow tensorflow keras

## Usage

Move all of your images into the **`target`** folder.
And then run the script using - 

    python .\predict_TM.py

Now sit back and relax, while the machine does its job!
